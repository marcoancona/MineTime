### Linux dependencies
MineTime store your account passwords in the local keychain. On Linux, this service is provided by `libsecret` so you may need to install it before running MineTime.

Depending on your distribution, you will need to run the following command:

- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`
- Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`
- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`

Some Linux distributions also require **`gnome-keyring`** (see https://github.com/marcoancona/MineTime/issues/98) and `libgconf-2-4` (see https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/1518).

If you find a distribution that needs additional dependencies, please contact us.

Understanding how time is spent is important to improve future scheduling decisions.

MineTime instantly shows you how often you met your colleagues in the past months, how many times an event has been already rescheduled and much more...

#### Cross-platform experience

MineTime is a calendar built on Electron, allowing it to run natively on Windows, Mac and - yes! - Linux. Enjoy the same smooth experience across all three!
